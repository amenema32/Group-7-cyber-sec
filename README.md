Project Title:
 Advanced Python-Based ARP Spoofing, Port Scanning, and HTTP Anomaly Detection
 
 In recent network environments, securing internal and external communications is mainthings  due to the growing number of cyberattacks 
 targeting vulnerabilities at different layers of the OSI model. Traditional firewalls and antivirus tools are often insufficient to detect 
 low-level or stealthy threats like ARP spoofing, SYN port scans, or unauthorized HTTP access.

Our project aims to build a lightweight yet effective  Detection System (IDS) using Python that can be deployed in educational labs and also 
small to medium networks for detecting and monitoring

Objective:
Detect ARP spoofing attacks by monitoring suspicious changes in IP-to-MAC mappings.

Identify port scanning behaviors 

Monitor and log abnormal or unauthorized HTTP requests, including uncommon paths or methods.


SCOPE:
COnsist of three main modules
1: ARP Spoof Detector
2:Port Scan Detector
3:HTTP Request Monitor

TOOLS AND TECH USED IN OUR PROJECT
*python3 
some python lib
platform Linux and Windows for testing
ide : VS code



IN FUTURE ENHANCEMENT
Optional enhancements (in future versions):

-Email  alerting
-JSON log output
-GeoIP tracking for incoming HTTP request

CONCULSION
OUR project provides a functional and modular Detection tool tailored for hands-on learning, research, and detection of common network threats using Python. It emphasizes visibility, modularity, and simplicity, making it ideal for cybersecurity students, ethical hackers, and small-scale defenders.
