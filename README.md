# Log File Anomaly Detector

**Log File Anomaly Detector** is a lightweight, real-time log anomaly detection tool written in Python.  

Itâ€™s designed to help **security operations teams** and **system administrators** detect suspicious activity early â€” such as repeated failed login attempts, suspicious commands, or potential brute-force attacks â€” without requiring a full SIEM stack.

It also helps **security analysts, incident responders, and IT admins** detect malicious activities such as:
- Ransomware encryption
- Unauthorized data exfiltration

Our project is **simple enough for small-scale deployment**, but **robust enough to be extended** for enterprise environments.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- **Real-time log monitoring** with pure-Python tailing (handles log rotation)
- **Threshold-based detection** of excessive authentication failures (configurable per IP)
- **Suspicious command detection**
- **Sliding time-window** logic
- **Polymorphic alerting**
- **Optional integration** with AbuseIPDB for threat intelligence enrichment
- **JSON config support** and flexible deployment
